Dear Ms/Mr <%=@name%>,

This is to inform you that the items listed below are going in expire in another 5 days.
This is your chance to consume them soon, so that they do not get wasted.

Important
UNâ€™s Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that the carbon footprint associated with wasted food worldwide each year is more than 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
Each year, 40% of the food produced in the US goes to waste, and expiry date plays an important role
Beware of what the expiry date means, and consume/donate the item based on it. This small step can make a huge impact on the food wastage

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Team ProductExpiryManager
